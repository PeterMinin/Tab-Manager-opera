						<p>Easy Tab Manager eases the management of tabs/windows, especially for those who like to keep a lot of tabs and windows opened.</p>
						<b>How to use:</b>
						<p>After opening the popup with the toolbar button, the first thing to do is nearly always (except at buttons with words 'auto' or 'all') to select your chosen tabs or windows for a certain action.</p>
						<p>The selection in the Window/Tab list is easy: just leftclick on an item to select it and do it again to unselect. You have to select tabs you can search for tabs in any of your Opera windows. You can also make actions with tabs from different windows at the same time.</p>
						<p>Note: You can select only windows or only tabs at the same time.</p>
						<p>After that click on the command button you need.</p>
