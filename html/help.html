						<p>Easy Tab Manager eases the management of tabs/windows, especially for those who like to keep a lot of tabs and windows opened.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>  Before you read below</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>After opening the popup with the toolbar button, the first thing to do is nearly always (except at buttons with words 'auto' or 'all') to select your chosen tabs or windows for a certain action.</p>
						<p>The selection in the Window/Tab list is easy: just leftclick on an item to select it and do it again to unselect. You have to select tabs you can search for tabs in any of your Opera windows. You can also make actions with tabs from different windows at the same time.</p>
						<p>Note: You can select only windows or only tabs at the same time.</p>
						<p>After that click on the command button you need.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Switch</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>You can switch to any window or tab by doubleclicking or rightclicking on it.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   New</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>You can open a new tab in any window, just select the right window and click New Tab to make it. If you don't select any windows, the new tab will appear in your active window. New Tab could only open 1 tab in a window but if you need tabs in separate windows it can open 1 in each of selected windows.</p>
						<p>Also, you can call New Windows.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Close</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Using Close Selected, you can close any number of selected tabs OR windows.</p>
						<p>Close All won't close Opera. It will keep one window with a new tab.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Reload</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Select the chosen tabs OR windows to use Reload Selection or just simply Reload All.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Pin</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Select any normal tabs and so Pin Selected will pin them. Click on the same button to unpin tabs, too. You can also pin and unpin tabs (based on their present state) with the same click.</p>
						<p>You can also Pin All tabs or Unpin All of them.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Private</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Similar to Pin, you can use Private Selected to private or unprivate or even doing both of them at the same time by one click, but you have to select no tabs but windows here (private tabs aren't reintroduced in Opera yet). There are also All Private and All Normal commands available for your convenience.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Move</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Click on Move Tabs after the selection. You'll get a message: "Please select target Window". Click OK and select a window: all selected tabs from any window will move into that window. The tabs will stay movable (by clicking the destination window) until you close the popup.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Split</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Using Split Selected, you'll get a new window and the all selected tabs will move into it.</p>
						<p>Autosplit gathers all pages downloaded from the same server and creates separate windows for each server where you'll find all related pages.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>   Clone</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Use Clone Selected to make clones for each of your selected tabs.</p>
