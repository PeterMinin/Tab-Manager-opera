TO DO
Current version:
* this won't be a general use but when I tried the Private selected on a normal new window and a private new window at the same time, I found that I got a private window and a normal window with a blank startpage containg 3 dead buttons (dial,stash,discover) on the top. I tried it again and now only the theme lacks.
* All Private doesn't give back the opened tabs; when using All private or All normal there is a chance that they reduce the number of windows to 1.
* Use backgorund page to get changes
* Display no. of tabs in Badge
* Add keyboard short-cuts.
* Performance improvements.
* Tooltips in bottom panel.
